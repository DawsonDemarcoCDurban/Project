        <h1>Proposed Solutions</h1>
        <p>
            Light pollution, the excessive or misdirected artificial light at night,
            has adverse effects on human health, wildlife, and astronomical observations. 
            To mitigate this problem, various solutions can be implemented,
            addressing both the technical and policy aspects of lighting. 
            Here are the key strategies to reduce light pollution:
        </p>
        <h2>1. Implementing Shielded Lighting</h1>
        <p>These lights direct all their illumination downward, where it is needed, 
            preventing unnecessary light from spilling upward into the sky. This reduces 
            skyglow and light trespass (light spilling into areas where it is not wanted, 
            such as residential windows).</p>

        </div>
        <h2>2. Using Warmer Color Lights</h3>
        <p>
            Blue light scatters more easily in the atmosphere
            and contributes heavily to skyglow. By using warmer
            color temperatures (typically below 3,000 Kelvin),
            especially in outdoor lights, the scattering effect 
            can be minimized.

        <h2>3. Smart Lighting Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            These can automatically adjust their brightness based on time of day or the 
            presence of people, improving energy efficiency and reducing light pollution 
            during late-night hours. Cities can adopt systems that allow them to remotely
            control public lighting, adjusting intensity based on weather, time, and specific 
            events.

        <h2>4. Protecting Natural Areas</h2>
        <p>
            Wildlife Conservation Zones: Some species, such as turtles and birds, are 
            particularly sensitive to light pollution. Protecting areas where these 
            animals live by reducing artificial lighting can help maintain their natural 
            behaviors and habitat.

        </div>
        <h2>5. Public Awareness and Education</h2>
        <p>
            Educating communities about the negative effects of light pollution on human health, 
            wildlife, and stargazing can encourage residents and businesses to use better lighting 
            practices.
