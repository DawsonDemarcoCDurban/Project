        <h1>Light Pollution Statistics</h1>
        <p>
            Light pollution, the excessive or
            misdirected artificial light in the
            environment, is a growing concern in
            the Philippines, particularly in urbanized
            regions. Here are some key statistics 
            highlighting its impact:
        </p>

        <h2>Metro Manila</h2>
        <p> The capital region exhibits significant 
            light pollution, with average sky 
            brightness levels around 23.4 magnitudes 
            per square arcsecond, indicating a 
            highly light-polluted night sky.

        <h2>2024 New Year's Eve Celebration</h2>
        <p> The graph illustrates the real-time PM₂.₅ concentrations
            in various sampling locations in the Philippines over 
            a 24-hour period from December 31, 2023 (12 PM) to 
            January 1, 2024 (12 PM). A sharp and significant spike 
            in PM₂.₅ levels is observed around midnight (January 1),
            particularly in San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan (light blue)
            and Calumpit, Bulacan (gray), likely due to New Year's
            Eve celebrations, such as fireworks and firecrackers.
            Other areas, including Davao City and Tagaytay, Cavite, 
            show relatively lower PM₂.₅ levels throughout the period, 
            indicating less pollution. After the midnight peak, PM₂.₅ 
            concentrations gradually decline in all locations, but 
            elevated levels persist for a few hours into the early 
            morning of January 1, 2024. (Manila Observatory, 2024)</p>

        <h2>Mindanao</h2>
        <p> Research indicates that light pollution in Mindanao has 
            been expanding, influencing local wildlife such as bat 
            populations. The spread of artificial lighting disrupts 
            natural habitats and behaviors, posing ecological 
            challenges.
